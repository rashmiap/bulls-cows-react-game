[**Bulls-Cows React Game**](https://github.com/rashmiap/bulls-cows-react-game)
-
Bulls and Cows is an old code breaking mind game.<br/>
The goal of this game is to guess a 4-digit number within the least number of attempts possible.<br/>
With every guess, you will get a feedback indicating how many Bulls and Cows you got with the guess.<br/>
A Bull means: one of the digits is correct, and is also at the right place.<br/>
A Cow means: one of the digits is a right number, but not at the right place.<br/>
For example, given that the answer is 0130, a guess of 3610 will receive 1 Bull 2 Cows. 1 Bull is 0, 2 Cows are 1 and 3.<br/>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
